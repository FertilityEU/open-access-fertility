# Open Access Fertility
## Generation Zero - what Europe’s falling birth rates reveal about inequality, pollution and public health.
“Generation Zero” explores how environmental and socioeconomic inequalities—such as pollution, income, and education—impact fertility rates :baby: across EU regions :earth_europe: (NUTS-2) from 2017 to 2019. The project uses open datasets from Eurostat, WHO, EEA, and EDGAR, combining them through KNIME and visualizing results with Plotly and Leaflet to reveal spatial mismatches in public health, environment, and demographic trends. :bar_chart:
